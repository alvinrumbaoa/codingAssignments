                    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                        language.Javascript is extremely popular for a variety
                        of
                        reasons.It is a small lightweight language allowing
                        maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch
                        of different directions. Javascript lives inside a
                        environment ( a web browser or Node Server), it can be
                        connected to the objects of these environments to
                        provide programmatic control them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>: Javascript
                            variables are containers for storing data values -
                            imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds
                            the coffee a variable holds a value. All JavaScript
                            variables must be identified with unique names.
                            These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var
                                x.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="#">Variable Assignments</a>: Assignment
                            operators assign values to JavaScript variables- our
                            cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving out
                            variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator
                            assigns a value to a variable <span>var x=10;</span></li>
                        <li><a href="#">Data Types</a>: Data types are an
                            important concept; to be able to operate on
                            variables you need to know the data type. There are
                            six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
                            Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>False</span>;
                            null - <span>null</span> aka nothing. Number -
                            <span>42 or 3.14159;</span>String - <span>'Coding
                                Dojo Rocks!'</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding',
                                'Dojo']</span> and Object <span>{first_name:
                                'Jane', lastname: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                        <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a>: When you write code,
                            you want to perform different actions for different
                            decision - hitting diferent code blocks based on
                            values or conditions that have been met. You can use
                            conditional statements in your code to accomplish
                            this. There are the following conditional
                            statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is
                            true, do this in our code block; <span>else if</span>
                            to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                            conditional statement is false; <span>else</span> we
                            execute this block of code</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Loops</a>: There are many different
                            kinds of loops in every programming language, but
                            they all essentialy do the same thins: they will
                            repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you
                            have to run a mile, well you run around the track
                            four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Function</a>:Functions are an
                            encaspulation of a code block, When we call our
                            function this will run the code block. Think of it
                            as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we
                            are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up
                            the instruction manual and get started, first we
                            screw the legs to the table top; next we place the
                            table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                            instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to
                            do so lets call out function over and over and over
                            again.</li>
